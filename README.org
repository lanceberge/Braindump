  This project includes all of my notes using [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]], an Emacs package for note-taking.

** How it works

   In my [[https://github.com/lanceberge/org-roam][org-roam]] directory, I added a Github Actions Workflow [[https://github.com/lanceberge/org-roam/blob/main/.github/workflows/convert_and_push_to_S3.yml][link]] which detects all modified org files.
   It converts them to HTML files using pandoc then pushes them to S3.
